        <p>
          William McGrath is a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Religious
          Studies Department at Manhattan College. He currently teaches an
          introductory course entitled the Nature and Experience of Religion, as
          well as more advanced seminars on Buddhism and the Religions of China
          and East Asia. He has also taught courses on Eastern Religions,
          Hinduism, and Religion and Medicine. For more information, please see
          his <a href="assets/mcgrath-cv.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>.

        <h2>The Nature and Experience of Religion</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="assets/2020-S-RELS-110-syllabus-updated.pdf" target="_blank"
            >Syllabus (Spring 2020)</a
          >: In this course we explore a wide range of religious theories,
          practices, and historical periods, as well as diverse modes of
          interpreting and comparing these traditions. In Part One we will begin
          with conflicts between duty and renunciation in early Hinduism, before
          turning to Buddhist explanations of karma and suffering in Part Two.
          In Part Three we focus on religious healing and specific religious
          communities in the modern United States, including those of Christian
          Science in Massachusetts and Hmong Shamanism in California. By taking
          this course, students will learn to read and interpret scripture,
          analyze and narratively explain the difficulties of life from multiple
          religious perspectives, and finally reconcile these diverse
          conceptions within the context of modern American society.

        <h2>Buddhism</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="assets/2020-S-RELS-354-syllabus-updated.pdf" target="_blank"
            >Syllabus (Spring 2020)</a
          >: This course is a general introduction to Buddhism, beginning with
          its scriptures, continuing with Buddhist transformations in East Asia,
          and concluding with mindfulness practices in the modern world. The
          course will examine the historical and cultural contexts in which
          Buddhist beliefs and practices developed, as well as the ways in which
          they are still developing today. We will read translations of
          scriptures attributed to the Buddha, the treatises of Buddhist
          practitioners, and the analyses of modern scholars. By completing this
          course students will become familiar with the historical development,
          major institutions, and major movements in the different types of
          Buddhism found throughout the world.

        <h2>Religions of China and East Asia</h2>

        <p>
          <a href="assets/2019-F-RELS-357.pdf" target="_blank"
            >Syllabus (Fall 2019)</a
          >: The religions of China and East Asia encompass such a vast and
          diverse array of cultural traditions, philosophical movements, and
          ritual practices that the very notion of “religion” in East Asia is
          difficult to separate from other aspects of society. In Part One of
          this course we begin with the ritual and ethical writings of
          Confucius, Laozi, and the major philosophers of the Warring States
          Period (475–221 BCE). In Part Two we turn to the introduction of
          Buddhism to East Asia and the development of Daoism in China, as
          demonstrated by the <em>Journey to the West</em>. Finally, in Part
          Three we focus on the religious traditions of modern Japan, including
          the effects of the World Wars on Shintoism and Zen Buddhism. In
          addition to learning the key ideas and practices of East Asian
          religions, throughout the course we will also consider broader human
          questions, such as the relationship between faith and doubt, nature
          and ritual, and the interaction of multiple religious traditions in
          the context of a pluralistic society.
